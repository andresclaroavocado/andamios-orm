## Getting Started

1. **New to Andamios ORM?** Start with [guides/getting-started.md](./guides/getting-started.md)
2. **Looking for specific functionality?** Check [api/](./api/) for detailed references
3. **Want to see real examples?** Browse [examples/](./examples/) for practical code
4. **Understanding the design?** Read [architecture/](./architecture/) for technical details

## Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows the same Example-Driven Development principles as our code:

1. **Examples First**: Every feature is demonstrated with practical examples
2. **Test-Driven**: All examples are tested and verified to work
3. **Real-World Focus**: Examples solve actual problems developers face
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build to advanced patterns

## Contributing to Documentation

- All code examples must be executable and tested
- Include type hints in all code samples
- Follow async-first patterns in examples
- Update documentation with any API changes
