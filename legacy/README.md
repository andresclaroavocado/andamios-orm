Modern, async-first Python database library for project management and architecture systems. Built specifically for the Web-Based Project Architect platform using DuckDB for high-performance analytical queries.

## üöÄ Features

- **Async-First**: Built on uvloop for maximum performance
- **DuckDB Optimized**: Leverages analytical capabilities for complex queries
- **Type-Safe**: Full SQLAlchemy 2.0+ and Pydantic v2 integration
- **100% Test Coverage**: Real database testing, no mocks
- **Parallel Testing**: Isolated databases per test worker
- **Example-Driven**: Comprehensive examples for all features
- **Production-Ready**: CI/CD, monitoring, and security built-in

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Models
- **Project**: Software project management with architecture tracking
- **Conversation**: Multi-phase conversation and workflow management  
- **Document**: Document and specification management
- **Repository**: Code repository tracking and analytics

### Repository Pattern
- Generic base repository with async CRUD operations
- Specialized repositories with domain-specific logic
- Advanced query builder with DuckDB optimization
- Cross-entity analytics and reporting

## üìã Development Status

This project follows **Example-Driven Development** followed by **Test-Driven Development**. 

### Development Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1**: Core Foundation (Setup, Engine, Models)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Repository Pattern (Base & Specialized Repos, Query Builder)
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Analytics (Advanced Analytics, CLI Tools)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Testing (100% Coverage, Performance Benchmarks)
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Integration (Examples, FastAPI, Real-time)
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Release (Documentation, CI/CD, Security)

See [GITHUB_ISSUES.md](GITHUB_ISSUES.md) for detailed development roadmap with 16 comprehensive issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start (Coming Soon)

```python
# Example usage (implementation coming in Phase 1-2)
from project_architect_db import DatabaseEngine, ProjectRepository
from project_architect_db.schemas import ProjectCreate

async def main():
    engine = DatabaseEngine("duckdb:///projects.db")
    
    async with engine.session() as session:
        async with ProjectRepository(session) as repo:
            project = await repo.create(ProjectCreate(
                name="My Project",
                description="A cool project",
                project_idea="Build something awesome"
            ))
            
            print(f"Created project: {project.name}")

# More examples coming in examples/ directory
```

## üß™ Testing (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests in parallel with real DuckDB
poetry run pytest -n auto --cov=src/project_architect_db

# Run performance benchmarks
poetry run pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only
```
